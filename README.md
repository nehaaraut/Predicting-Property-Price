### Problem Statement 
There are a number of factors which determine property prices, some are logical, based on economic theories and population density and some are based on more intangible factors, like availability of amenities & necessities, neighborhood, etc. Building a linear regression model to predict the price of the property from the dataset having attributes such as sale type, sale condition etc. 


#### Evaluation Parameters 
Evaluation is based on: 
•	Data Preprocessing 
•	Model Comparison 
•	Model Selection 

#### Data Preprocessing 
Checking the data distribution of variables and performrd transformation if a variable’s distribution is skewed. Performed label encoding on categorical variables.

#### Model Comparison 
Build linear regression models and compare results.

#### Model Selection 
Select the best model. Model selection to be based on model accuracy. 

#### Expected Outcome 
Low RMSE and high coefficient of determination(R^2)is expected while predicting the outcome using test data
